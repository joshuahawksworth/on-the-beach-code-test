You can preview this project without a download by using [this](https://on-the-beach-code-test.vercel.app/) link.

## Building the App

To build the app for yourself, you can use one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build
# or
bun build
```

You can then run one of the following commands to get started!

# On the Beach Frontend Software Engineer code test

Produce a HTML, CSS and JavaScript representation of the given `design.png` with the following features:

- Sort the results by price (this should be the default)
- Sort the results by star rating and highlight when active
- Sort the results alphabetically by hotel name and highlight when active
- Ability to toggle expanded hotel description

We are looking for a client side solution, there should be no server logic involved.

Feel free to use JavaScript libraries or frameworks. Imagine this will be a component added to a large website.

You may use things like CSS Preprocessors and JavaScript build tools, but if you do please include the dependencies/source files.
Feel free to source your own icons.

Things we like:

- Semantic HTML
- Modular CSS
- Error/warning free JavaScript
- Clean flow of state throughout the application
